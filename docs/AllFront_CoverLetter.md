Thank you for considering my application.

On the JavaScript side, two years ago, I spent three months completing the React Pluralsight Path to develop my firm's first client-facing website. Although the site was live and successful it's been some time since then, I thoroughly enjoyed working with React and wanted to deepen my expertise. However, my firm decided to transition to using HTMX (formerly known as Intercooler.js).

Despite my 7 years of experience, I remain a passionate developer with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Over the past two years, Iâ€™ve committed to spending at least 1-2 hours daily on improving my skills with other technologies such as Lisp, Go, and C, with plans to explore even more in the future.

If needed, I am willing to consider a drop in remuneration as long as the right learning opportunities are in place.

I would love the opportunity to discuss this further. Thank you for your time and consideration.
