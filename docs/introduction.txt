I have 7+ years of experience with .Net.
 
I am based in Sofia, Bulgaria
 
I am aiming to start a new position come October 1st.
 
I am looking for a full-time remote position in Bulgaria. I could consider a hybrid model of work with one day a week at the office in Sofia, Bulgaria.
 
My current target is 8-10k BGN net.
 
I am also looking for a permanent contracting role in the UK. My hourly wage target is £31-£36. By permanent I mean one to be renewed every year. We could sing a year long contract.
 
Professionally, I'm most experienced in Windows, .NET backend, Azure DevOps and Azure. However, I am looking to expand my tech stack with a React, Angular or a Vue front end. I am also eager to look into a team that works on Linux as I've loved my experience with Windows Subsystems for Linux.
 
I also have some non-professional experience with Go and wouldn't mind expanding my horizons that way.
 
I've also non-professionally dabbled in Lisp and am eager to look into Scala, Clojure or another functional language. Mobile development has also been interesting to me. I am willing to consider a drop in my compensation due to my lack of experience in that area. Keep in mind, I will be a fast learner and will study in my free time in order to start contributing as soon as I can.
