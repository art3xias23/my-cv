Thank you for considering my application.

I have been responsible for multiple applications with my current employer, where I’ve developed, enhanced, and managed their CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, I’ve created,  maintained these applications and ensured their smooth operation.

I've dabbled in redis briefly, albeit my professional experience being mostly in RabbitMQ as a message broker.

Whenever possible, I have championed the documentation of my projects using Atlassian. My passion for documenting and sharing knowledge led me to create a blog (blog.pragmatino.xyz) using Go, HTMX, and MongoDB, where I post about interesting findings and the technologies I explore.

During the last 6 months I've been solely responsible for my team's first web project. The frontend was done in HTMX due to the lack of complex FE requirements. Despite that bein a new technology for me I had completely excelled in it in the matter of weeks.

On the JavaScript side, two years ago, I spent three months completing the React Pluralsight Path to develop my firm's first client-facing website. Although the site was live and successful, it’s been some time since then. I thoroughly enjoyed working with React and wanted to deepen my expertise. However, my firm decided to transition to using HTMX (formerly known as Intercooler.js).

Despite Angular not being the same as React I have all the resources I need to excell in it, the only precursor would be a supportive and progresss driven team.

Despite my 7 years of experience, I remain a passionate developer with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Over the past two years, I’ve committed to spending at least 1-2 hours daily on improving my skills with other technologies such as Lisp, Go, and C, with plans to explore even more in the future.

I want to assure you that, even if I haven’t had the privilege of working with a particular technology, I will do my utmost to learn and contribute to your team as quickly as possible.

I would love the opportunity to discuss this further. Thank you for your time and consideration.
