Dear Rossiana, 

I come from a strong .NET background. 7 years and ongoing. 

I am looking for a new challenge.

I am looking to pick up a JS, Typescript, Docker, Cloud stack.

I am willing to start as a High Junior, Low Mid. 

My github profile has shown that I am constantly exploring new things and picking them up fast. 

I am willing to dedicate much of my time at the start so that I can begin to contribute as soon as possible.

I believe dynamic environment is perfect for me, as that would allow me to pick things up fast. Also my dedication to my previous employer has shown that I am no mercenary and am here for the long haul. 

I appreciate your time in reading this message.

Kind regards, 

Tino
